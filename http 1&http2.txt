* http1.1 load resources in one by one but http2 load resource in multiple data in single time via TCP,here TCP stands for transfer controll protocol

* Header compression Small files load more quickly than large ones. To speed up web performance, both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 compress HTTP messages to make them smaller.

*http2 having the advanced compression method called HPACK that eliminats  redundant information in http header packets .

*They eliminates a few bytes from every http packets.here the volume of HTTP pockets involved i loading even a single webpage
